Description: 

The installation was inspired from the theme of the COS collection «*Modern Utility*» dealing with simple, optimised forms created by modern technology. Driven by a focus on modularity, the overall concept is based on rapid building and disassembly, designed after the structural codes of the atomic form. This centrepiece, a 3D-printed constructing atom, can create an infinite number of geometric sculptures, offering a high degree of modularity and permutations.

To enable rapid building, each piece, colour, and material corresponds to a useful and precise place. Colours were chosen to enhance the product’s visibility and presentation, to contrast with the selected space and construction system. Indeed, this building paradigm can create an endless stream of COS product displays. This pop-up concept, like the timeless white oxford shirt, has no lifespan, and can live in any shape, space, or scale.
