Description: 

Once again taking a conceptual approach to illustrate transhumanism (*literally, an intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition through technology*), we focused our approach on transforming a human protagonist through material and optical effects. 
Using prisms and other experimental materials, we took an interpretive approach to the topics elicited in the magazine’s text, including cybernetics, digital identity, robotics, and other such far-flung technologies.
