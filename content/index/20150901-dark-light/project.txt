Description: To launch the new Nike x PSG kit, Bonsoir Paris was brought on board to come up with a creative concept, design and production for the retail displays across Colette, Nike Champs Elysées, the PSG store and VIP Nike showroom. Taking the cues of the collection’s tagline ‘*Engineered Invisibility*’ we created a dark, futuristic and powerful visual using robotics and kinetic light scanners. The marble, fibre glass and chrome finishing give the luxurious effect of a powerful football player ; a human with enhanced ability to go that extra mile. The kinetic structures bring to life and hero the individual players.
