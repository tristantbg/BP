Text: 

Heady, head in the burbs techno culminations from Newcastle, Australia and producer Jordon Alexander who dips back into an insanely prolific production spell earlier this year (and follows up an EP on Collect Call) with four new tracks.

Mall Grab’s ethereality is shadowy, mixed with familiar night drive sensations and drugged out Strictly Rhythm vibes; mildly celestial “hella stoned” introspections that pay homage to old Three 6 Mafia mixtapes as much as more recent astral experiences in house and techno.

Starting off with the faded menace of vocal track “Awake”, which builds in steps into heavy, lo-fi 4/4 120 techno, the EP moves into hazy, sweaty and pumping zones on “Elegy” and then to the b-side with the sunnier/just-woke-up feelings of “Never”, before blurring into the melodic drift of slow burner “Drive”, nostalgia-coated, hybridized and heavy all the way.

Description: 

As part of Courvoisier's "*Exceptional Journey*" campaign Bonsoir Paris, collaborating with American fashion brand En Noir, reinterpreted their design codes through a sculptural installation inspired by their material choices, cuts and details. Mixing both image and design, the installation presents hand-crumpled metal prints in a simple and radical way. 

A photographic sculpture immersing the audience into different tones and vibrations of black. The reverse of the installation reflects distorted versions of the surrounding environment ; a comment on the strength of identity the clothes create.
