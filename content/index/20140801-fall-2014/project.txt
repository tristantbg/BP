Description: For the front cover of *It's Nice That's* Autumn issue we were inspired by a literal interpretation of the fall, we designed a set consisting of an infinitely black abyss, into which we projected a nondescript plastic ball. The process involved a controlled projection of the ball in order to create a rhythmic liquid reaction. After hundreds of attempts, we captured the final image in one shot, freezing the enveloping encounter of liquid and solid forms.
