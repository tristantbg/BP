Description: 

This «*substance*» is a synthetic form composed of a single material (of which the composition is unknown), and a random physical reality. 
As spectators, we are not equipped with enough information about its nature to understand its origins. It seems, however, that it is a new state of matter (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma), found in several stages of its formation by a single contradictory factor, a human being. It’s evolution is not based on any quantifiable or predictable criteria; its transition is instantaneous, reacting to any environmental or atmospheric factor. This instability does not permit a controlled utilisation of the material, rather behaving like an organism with its own prerogative and volitions.
