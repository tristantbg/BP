Description: Our proposal for the Intel Edison stands sought to present the myriad 250 individual components of the platform in a straightforward but exciting manner. Paired with an app repository of every component, the display is a physical manifestation of the digital catalogue, and was grouped into different zones of interaction and presentation. The table is presented as the centrepiece of the module, the core of the Intel Edison platform and a place of conversation. The showcases correspond to different categories of products available. The wall provides prototypes created with an assimilation of these components. Additionally, we designed a bespoke light / sound instrument that harnessed the power of the platform to create a memorable takeaway of the power of the platform. The result was a seamless experience of the product, both from an educational and functional standpoint,  as well as an engaging and interactive one.
