Description: 

We focused our creative approach on a photography editorial based on the physical phenomenon of dark matter, applied to a contextual scale. Theoretically omnipresent in space, dark matter deforms our Earth-based perception of stellar objects on the other end   of our universe. 

We sought to illustrate this concept by experimenting with different effects of dysmorphic perception of a body projected in an astral world.
