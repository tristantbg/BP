Description: 

While keeping the brand’s heritage and identity, we offered a digital interpretation of various states of water, an omnipresent element in Amsterdam. The designs mingle the vaulted Hermes collection with waterfalls, waves, jets and water drops, consisting of a kind of ‘*nature 2.0*’ of trees and rocks. 
Between fixed and dynamic animated windows, water is represented by systems of simple constructions pushed to their limits, a complexity close to nature.
