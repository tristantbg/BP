Description: 

Galeries Lafayette’s “*Quoi de Neuf*” has become, throughout its many seasonal editions, a must-see event for the discovery of new trends in fashion. This time, the department store was guided by the theme of the “*white page*”, to immerse the spectator in a surrealist universe, punctuated by purity and minimalism. 
In order to illustrate this concept, we created 16 window installations that highlight a thematic detail of the pure page, a characteristic that renders each product exceptional.
