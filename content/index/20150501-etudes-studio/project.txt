Description: For each season, we take inspiration from the directive lines of the collection, whether  motorcycle graphic design culture or minimal Japanese architectural codes. These interpretations are then manifested in a retail scenography showcasing the more prominent pieces of the collection in a manner that distinguishes the brand from its retail contemporaries. Bold colours and shapes alongside simple modular forms make the collection and brand stand out in each environment.
