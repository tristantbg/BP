Description: Taking the strong identity and codes of the brand the installations were inspired from Japanese minimalism and vitality. Both timeless and contemporary the design rhymes the silhouette of Sonia by Sonia Rykiel, between urban sensuality and reworked traditional codes. For the photography look-book, shot with the innovative photographer Charlie Engman, we reinterpreted the graphic identity of the collection with playful forms which were interacted with by the models in an improvisational manner. The presentation scaled this concept to the size of a sort of art gallery playground, where the models presented the collection by interacting with hanging strips of coloured fluid paper. These interactions brought life to this forest; waving and wafting with the movements of the models.
