Description: Through the lens of a fashion editorial, an omnipresent intelligence is manifested in an ethereal and interpretative manner. AI is often thought of as an extension of human intelligence, something that will extend our capacities beyond what is possible with our organic sentiments. In this story, this machine intelligence has permeated the boundary of what should be considered human or organic. Through in-camera effects and material experimentations, the perceived identity of this entity becomes malformed and disturbed, climaxing in a final encounter between our manifestation of AI and her human counterpart.
