Description: We developed a campaign involving event, campaign photography, and retail directives that were displayed in all of Nike Lab’s locations, as well as select retailers throughout the world. The core concept of this campaign centers on the modularity of the Nike x JFS collection, focused on the evolution of body and style through training. The thinking is based on examining what modularity for clothing means in terms of sequence, function, and change while portraying the multiple variations of the Nike x JFS collection in a clear and iconic way.
